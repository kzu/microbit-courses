*	Strand 6.3: Earth’s Weather Patterns and Climate
All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet’s systems. Heat energy from the Sun, transmitted by radiation, is the primary source of energy that affects Earth’s weather and drives the water cycle. Uneven heating across Earth’s surface causes changes in density, which result in convection currents in water and air, creating patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional and global climates.
*	Standard 6.3.2
Investigate the interactions between air masses that cause changes in weather conditions. Collect and analyze weather data to provide evidence for how air masses flow from regions ... Examples of data collection could include field observations, laboratory experiments, weather maps, or diagrams.
*	Standard 6.3.3
Develop and use a model to show how unequal heating of the Earth’s systems causes patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates. Emphasize how warm water and air move from the equator toward the poles. Examples of models could include Utah regional weather patterns such as lake-effect snow and wintertime temperature inversions.
*	Strand 8.4 Interactions with Natural Systems and Resources
*	Standard 8.4.4
Analyze and interpret data on the factors that change global temperatures and their effects on regional climates. Examples of factors could include agricultural activity, changes in solar radiation, fossil fuel use, and volcanic activity. Examples of data could include graphs of ... global and regional temperatures.

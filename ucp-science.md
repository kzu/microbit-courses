# Science Experiments

![A watering plant with a @boardname@](/static/courses/ucp-science.jpg)

The **Science Experiments** are lessons geared for students in middle school and early high school grades. The lessons are designed help the student gain a greater understanding of the forces and behavior of the physical world. This is done using methods of observation, measurement, and data analysis. By incorporating the micro:bit in the experiments, the lessons are a great way to teach both science and computing in the same activity.
 
These lessons guide the student in hands-on, practical measurement activities along with using the micro:bit to control and record data for the experiments. Each lesson provides an overview of the activity, outlines expected results, explains the setup of the experiment, and the gives a coding activity to measure and collect the data.

## Lesson series

### ~hint

This is a new course, so we're adding new lessons. All lessons will be available here shortly. These lessons require [Windows 10 MakeCode for micro:bit app](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJC7SV48LCX)
